## Features

  

| | Feature | Description |

|----|-------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|

| ‚öôÔ∏è | **Architecture** | A simple PHP project utilizing the MVC (Model-View-Controller) design pattern with Bootstrap for frontend style and navigation. |

| üî© | **Code Quality** | Code is well-organized with clear naming conventions. PHP CS Fixer is used for code style consistency. |

| üìÑ | **Documentation** | Includes basic README file describing project setup and usage. |

| üîå | **Integrations** | Bootstrap CSS/JavaScript for frontend styling, navbar, and responsive design. No other notable integrations or dependencies mentioned in the codebase. |

| üß© | **Modularity** | Modularized with separate files for controllers, views, models, and a clear separation of concerns between frontend (HTML/CSS) and backend (PHP). |

| üß™ | **Testing** | No specific testing frameworks mentioned. Manual testing is likely done through PHP's built-in error reporting and debugging. |

| ‚ö°Ô∏è | **Performance** | Not explicitly evaluated based on the information provided. Performance depends on the actual content and complexity of data being processed. |

| üõ°Ô∏è | **Security** | Uses no specific security measures mentioned in the codebase. Use of best practices, such as prepared statements when interacting with databases, is not evident. |

| üì¶ | **Dependencies** | Depends solely on 'php'. Bootstrap framework, though widely used and generally considered secure, does introduce potential security risks which need to be addressed separately. |
